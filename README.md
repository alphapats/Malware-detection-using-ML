# Malware-detection-using-ML

Malware infections is one of most common security risks which can lead to
loss and compromise of data and privacy and often leads to loss of money(Eg
Ransomware). The Windows OS is one of most commonly used OS and also
most suspectible to malware infections. In our project, we have surveyed and
implemented machine learning based technique to classify file as benign or
malicious with high accuracy and low computational power. Out of 56 raw
features in our dataset, after modification, we have selected only 28 features.
We applied various Machine learning algorithms and achieved accuracy upto
99%. Additionally, we analysed false positives and false negatives to un-
derstand how file header values control maliciousness of the file. Also, we
tried to modify PE header values of few malicious files to check our classifier
